For this experiment, you must read a list of words, but you must say the colour of the word. Not the word itself. For example, for the word, <font
color="#0000cc"><strong>GREEN</strong></font>, you should say "Blue."<p>

<p>

Once the words appear, read the list as fast as you can. When you are finished, click the "Finished!" button.
<p>
The test will be done two times. The first will be easy, while the second one will be a little more difficult.
